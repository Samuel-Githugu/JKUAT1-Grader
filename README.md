This was my first coding assignment during my one year stint studying Computer Science (BSc.) at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. 
The code is meant to calculate and output a given student's grades based on specific parameters and weighted evaluation of their CAT, Assignment and Examination scores.
The code is written entirely in C.
